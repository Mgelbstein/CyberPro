# CyberPro
"Cyber-Pro" - a website which would use fun games and quizzes to teach cybersecurity to children!
We created this mock-website for a Touro University Hackathon. The idea was to create a website that will find
fun ways to teach kids about cyber security. With this, we'd hope that kids will understand how to navigate themselves in
a world filled with technology as safely as they can.
